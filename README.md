## 📌 Overview

This project was built to solve **[specific problem]** using a clean, maintainable, and scalable approach.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

* Clear problem understanding
* Thoughtful design decisions
* Readable and maintainable code
* Practical engineering trade-offs

This is **not a demo project**, but a learning-focused implementation aligned with real-world engineering practices.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In many real-world applications, **[describe the problem clearly]**.

Existing solutions often:

* Are overly complex
* Do not scale well
* Lack clarity or maintainability

This project explores a **simpler and more structured approach** to address these challenges.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a clear and understandable solution
* Apply core computer science fundamentals
* Follow clean code and modular design principles
* Ensure the project is easy to extend and maintain

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**

* JavaScript / TypeScript / Python (as applicable)

**Frameworks & Libraries**

* React / Next.js / Node.js (as applicable)

**Database**

* MongoDB / MySQL (if used)

**Tools**

* Git, GitHub
* Docker (if applicable)

---

## 🧱 System Design (High-Level)

* Modular component-based structure
* Clear separation of concerns
* Predictable data flow
* Simple and readable architecture

*(Optional: Add a simple diagram later)*

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Feature 1: Brief explanation
* Feature 2: Brief explanation
* Feature 3: Brief explanation

Focus on **what the system does**, not marketing language.
